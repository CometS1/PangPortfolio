            </a>
            <p class="lead story">This is a pet sitter app that I made with a team during a course with Hatchways. It uses
                Express, React, and MongoDB, and allows users to create a account, and find and requests other pet
                sitters that have created a profile on the site to take care of their pets while they are away. This one
                was tough, implementing Express to deal with routing, and figuring out how to make post requests through MongoDB was not
                easy, but we made it through and got it working!

            </a>
            <p class="lead story">This is an Android app that is was meant to be used to record the jobs that the user
                applied to. It was originally meant to work with the job site Indeed, though because our group could not
                get access to the Indeed API, we had to improvise and made it work with Github jobs instead. How the app
                works is that the user can view any job on Github Jobs, and then once they find the jobs they have
                applied to, they can add it to a list of applied jobs. After, the user can make notes, and record when
                they recieve an interview for the job position.

                to assist players of the roleplaying game D&D. There are a list of spell descriptions on the page, which
                are associated with spells in the game. The easy part was making the page, the hard part was inputting
                all the information on the spells!

            </a>
            <p class="lead story">This was a project I made for a blockchain hackathon on Gitcoin. It uses Skale File
                Storage to store data directly to your blockchain account, which allows for more secure data due to the
                nature of blockchain. Due to complications with integrating Skale, this project is a reskin of the
                existing Skale demo for file storage using Bootstrap.
