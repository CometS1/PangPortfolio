            <h1 class="centered"><em>Field of Work</em></h1>
            <p class="lead story">I decided to go into the field of computer programming because I felt that it was a
                field that had nearly unlimited possibilities and there would always be something to learn. From
                software development to artificial intelligence to blockchaining, after stepping into the field I've
                learned that there will never be a dull moment with computer programming.

            <h1 class="centered"><em>Work Ethics</em></h1>
            <p class="lead story">I personally believe "You should work hard to take it easy". What I mean by this
                is that you should always be thinking of the most effective way to solve a problem, and put in the
                effort to make that happen. However, this is much different from simply taking shortcuts or the easy way
                out. To do this you will have to understand what is necessary to achieve that action, what will occur
                when you take that action, and the results of any action you take. It's making sure that you take the
                most effecient actions with the most beneficial results and the least sacrifices. For example, if you
                have to make reports every day for your job, you could take the necessary time to work on it every day,
                which could be several hours, or you could make a program that can deal with the issue in a couple of
                minutes. Making the program might take a couple of weeks depending on your skills, but in exchange for
                maybe fourty hours of programming, you could save thousands of hours of report making, which is actually
                something I've done before for a job when I had to make reports using Microsoft Excel and created a
                macro using Visual Basic to do it for me.</p>

        <div class="container border border-dark rounded list-box">
            <h1 class="centered"><em>Beliefs</em></h1>
            <p class="lead story">From my perspective, there are two things that make up a person: genes and memories.
                When someone is born, their genes act as a sort of skeletal structure for how certain events in their
                life will affect their personality. Two people can experience the same events in their lives and be
                affected in completely different ways. But before trying to understand someone else, you need to
                understand yourself. I try to make sure that I know myself the best, and the experiences that make up
                myself, so I can look at other's views objectively and without bias. Since we're all human beings, and
                humans have several psychological tendencies that are impossible to ignore, such as the need for other
                people, understanding yourself will always make someone better at understanding another person's
                perspective.</p>

            <h1 class="centered"><em>Hobbies</em></h1>
            <p class="lead story">My two favourite hobbies are playing games and baking desserts. I love nearly every
                game, from strategy games to action games, and enjoy play them in my spare time. To me, there is nothing
                more satisfying them succeeding in an seemingly-impossible challenge. I also love playing tabletop games
                with others, from board games like Monopoly, to role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons. Games are
                meant to be played with other people, after all. Baking is another past time of mine that I enjoy. From
                cookies to cakes, I've baked many different desserts over the years, and love making tasty foods that
                both look good and taste great.</p>
