            <h1 class="centered"><em>Field of Work</em></h1>
            <p class="lead story">I decided to go into the field of computer programming because I felt that it was a
                field that had a large amount of possibilities and would always have something to learn. From software
                development to artificial intelligence to blockchaining, I knew that there will never be a dull moment
                with computer programming.

        <div class="container border border-dark rounded list-box">
            <h1 class="centered"><em>Work Ethics</em></h1>
            <p class="lead story">I personally believe "You should work hard to take it easy". What I mean by this
                is that you should always be thinking of the most effective way to come about a problem, and put in the
                effort to make that happen. This is much different from simply taking shortcuts or the easy way out. To
                do this you will have to understand what is necessary to achieve that action, what will occur when you
                take that action, and the results of any action you take. It's making sure that you take the most
                effecient actions with the most beneficial results. For example, if you have to make reports every day
                for your job, you could take the necessary time to work on it every day, which could be several hours,
                or you could make a program that can deal with the issue in a couple of minutes. Making the program
                might take a couple of weeks depending on your skills, but for maybe fourty hours of programming, you
                could save thousands of hours of report making.</p>

        <div class="container border border-dark rounded list-box">
            <h1 class="centered"><em>Beliefs</em></h1>
            <p class="lead story">From my perspective, there are two things that make up a person: genes and memories.
                When
                someone is born, their genes act as a sort of skeletal structure for how certain events in their life
                will affect their personality. Two people can experience the same events in their lives and be affected
                in completely different ways. But before trying to understand someone else, you need to understand
                yourself. I try to make sure that I know myself the best, and the experiences that make up myself, so I
                can look at other's views objectively and without bias.</p>

        <div class="container border border-dark rounded list-box">
            <h1 class="centered"><em>Hobbies</em></h1>
            <p class="lead story">My two favourite hobbies are playing games and baking desserts. I love nearly every
                game,
                from strategy games to action games, and play them in my spare time. To me, there is nothing more
                satisfying them succeeding in an seemingly-impossible challenge. I also love playing tabletop games
                with others, from board games like Monopoly, to role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons. Baking is
                another past time of mine that I enjoy. From cookies to cakes, I've baked many different desserts over
                the years, and love making tasty foods to eat.</p>
